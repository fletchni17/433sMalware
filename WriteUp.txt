1) A Key-Management-Based Taxonomy for Ransomware


-------------------------------Obfuscation------------------------------------------------------------




--------------------------------Encryption------------------------------------------------------------


This basic hybrid (symmetric+asymmetric) key model
works in the following steps:
1) Ransomware compromises host and commences execution.
2) Cryptographic APIs available on the host are used to
generate an encryption key such as an AES-256 key.
3) Ransomware encrypts this symmetric key with a
hard-coded asymmetric key (e.g. RSA-2048) and communicates a copy of the now encrypted symmetric key
to the attacker.
4) User data is encrypted using the symmetric key.
5) Ransomware securely destroys the symmetric key on
the host machine, now making the attacker the sole
possessor of the decryption key.
6) A ransom note is displayed to the user while ransomware awaits payment.
